/*b) Re-write the above exercise with functions: Write a function called encrypt which 
takes as a parameter a string and changes it to the encrypted version (as described 
above). Write also a function called decrypt which takes as a parameter a string an 
decrypts the string i.e. restores it to the original. For example decrypting the string s1
containing “dbu” will convert it back to the string “cat”. (i.e. replace ‘d’ with ‘c’, ‘b’
with ‘a’ and so on, thus reversing the coding scheme used for encryption above). 
Write a main program to test both functions.*/
